I am using enumeration for filtering/sorting statuses because it will be easear to change
I am using spread operator to do not mutate the state.
Initial state is empty array and I am setting it to the data on componentDidMount as it would be if we are fetching data from the server.
The application state is hold in the class component App, and the data and onChange method are passing via props to stateless components.
I am using the simpliest sorting for numbers - applying Array.prototype.sort 
For the active status I am using Array.prototype.filter method
For the default data i am using data.js
