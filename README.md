Initial state is set to data.js data
I am using spread operator to do not mutate the state.
The application state is hold in the class component App, and the data and onChange method are passing via props to stateless components.
I am using Array.prototype.sort method for descending sorting and Array.prototype.filter method for showing active.
I am separating the logic for sorting in helpers.js
